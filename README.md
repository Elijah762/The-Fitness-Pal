Description of app
*********************
    Do you find yourself feeling like you over eat day to day, under eat day to day, or even find yourself as a health 
    conscious person? If so than this is the app for you! Fitness-Pal is an all in one app that calculates your necessary 
    daily caloric intake based on your Biometrics and allows you to input your meals for the day into an easy to read 
    daily calendar that tracks calories eaten compared to your recommended caloric intake on a weekly basis.  
    
How to run
**************
1. Assure your machine meets all the Version Requirements listed at the bottom of this read me file. 
2. Download the zip file of this repository and open it in your desired IDE.
3. If running on Windows be sure that line 103 and line 109 may need to be changed to have ".\\"
   added to the front of user.properties, however this should only be done if "Recommended Weekly Intake" produces an error.
4. Assure that the properties files named "user.properties", "foodData.properties", and "dates.properties" exist before running
   the app.
5. Enjoy Fitness-Pal!
    
Known Bug
